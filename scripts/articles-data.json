    "category": "neurodiversity",
    "overview": "ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition that involves differences in attention regulation, impulse control, and hyperactivity. It is recognized as a lifelong condition, though symptoms can change over time (1).\n\nPeople with ADHD often exhibit creativity, high energy, and the ability to think outside the box. However, they may also experience challenges with organization, focus, and time management (2).",
    "mechanisms": "Research has linked ADHD to differences in dopamine and norepinephrine signaling, which affect executive function and reward pathways in the brain (3). Structural MRI studies show variations in the prefrontal cortex and striatum (4).",
    "safety": "ADHD itself is not dangerous, but untreated symptoms can lead to difficulties in academic, work, and social settings (5). Evidence-based treatments, including behavioral therapy and medications like stimulants, can improve quality of life (6).",

    "category": "neurodiversity",
    "overview": "Dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental difference that affects reading and language processing skills. It is not a reflection of intelligence or effort (1). While reading difficulties are the hallmark, many individuals with dyslexia have strong problem-solving abilities and creative thinking skills (2).",
    "mechanisms": "Research suggests that dyslexia involves differences in the way the brain processes phonological information and in connectivity within language-related networks (3). Structural and functional MRI studies have found differences in the left hemisphere's language regions (4). Genetic factors also contribute to dyslexia risk (5).",

    "mechanisms": "TS is linked to differences in the brain's motor circuits, including the basal ganglia and cortical-striatal-thalamo-cortical loops (3). Dopaminergic pathways are thought to play a key role in tic generation and regulation (4). Genetic factors also contribute to TS risk (5).",
