    "summary": "CBT is a structured, evidence-based psychotherapy that helps people change unhelpful thoughts and behaviors to improve mental health.",
    "category": "interventions",
    "overview": "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a short-term, goal-oriented psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. It's one of the most widely studied and practiced forms of therapy for a range of mental health conditions.",
    "how_it_works": "CBT involves:\n- **Identifying negative or distorted thoughts** that contribute to distress.\n- **Challenging and restructuring these thoughts** to be more balanced and realistic.\n- **Engaging in behavioral experiments and skill-building exercises** to reinforce new thinking patterns.\n\nIt's typically delivered in a structured, time-limited format (e.g., 12–20 sessions).",
    "evidence_base": "Hundreds of randomized controlled trials support CBT's effectiveness for depression, anxiety, OCD, PTSD, and other conditions (1).",
    "effectiveness": "CBT is considered a first-line treatment for many mental health conditions and has comparable effectiveness to medications for mild to moderate depression and anxiety (2).",
    "practical_applications": "- CBT can be delivered individually, in groups, or through online platforms.\n- It's often incorporated into treatment plans for mood disorders, trauma, and substance use.\n- Techniques like thought records and exposure tasks are core components.",
    "common_myths": "1. **Myth:** CBT is just about 'positive thinking.'  \n**Fact:** CBT focuses on realistic, balanced thinking, not mere positivity.\n\n2. **Myth:** It only works if you're motivated.  \n**Fact:** While motivation helps, skilled therapists can engage even skeptical clients effectively.",
    "risks_and_limitations": "CBT may not be suitable for everyone. Some find it overly structured or challenging if trauma has not been processed first. Also, access to trained CBT therapists can be a barrier.",
    "future_directions": "Future developments include digital CBT tools, culturally adapted CBT, and integrating CBT with mindfulness and neurofeedback techniques (3).",

    "category": "interventions",
    "overview": "Medications for mental health conditions include antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and anxiolytics. These medications target neurotransmitter systems and can reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, psychosis, and mood instability.",
    "how_it_works": "Different classes of medications work by altering neurotransmitter levels in the brain:\n- **Antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs)** boost serotonin and/or norepinephrine.\n- **Antipsychotics** block dopamine receptors.\n- **Mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium)** regulate mood swings.\n- **Benzodiazepines** enhance GABA to reduce anxiety.\n\nTreatment typically requires several weeks for full effects.",
    "evidence_base": "Thousands of clinical trials demonstrate the efficacy of psychiatric medications in treating conditions like depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder (1).",
    "effectiveness": "Medications can be highly effective, especially for moderate to severe symptoms, though responses vary between individuals (2).",
    "practical_applications": "- Often combined with psychotherapy.\n- Monitoring for side effects is essential.\n- Dosage and duration should be regularly reviewed by a prescribing professional.",
    "common_myths": "1. **Myth:** Medications 'cure' mental illness.  \n**Fact:** Medications manage symptoms, but often work best with therapy and lifestyle changes.\n\n2. **Myth:** All psychiatric medications are addictive.  \n**Fact:** Most (like antidepressants) are not addictive, though some (like benzodiazepines) carry dependence risks.",
    "risks_and_limitations": "Side effects, such as weight gain or sedation, can occur. Long-term use of certain medications requires careful monitoring (e.g., lithium and kidney function). Not everyone responds to the first medication tried.",

    "overview": "Mindfulness involves paying attention to the present moment with an open, accepting attitude. Practices like meditation and mindful breathing are increasingly used to support mental health and stress reduction.",
    "how_it_works": "Mindfulness helps individuals notice thoughts and feelings without judgment, reducing reactivity and promoting calm. It strengthens brain networks related to emotion regulation (1).",
    "evidence_base": "Randomized controlled trials show mindfulness can reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, and chronic pain (2).",

    "category": "interventions",
    "overview": "Psychedelics are substances that alter perception, mood, and cognition. In recent years, research has renewed interest in their therapeutic potential for mental health conditions when administered in controlled settings.",
    "how_it_works": "Psychedelics like psilocybin (in magic mushrooms) and MDMA (commonly known as 'ecstasy') act primarily on serotonin receptors (1). They promote intense emotional experiences, which may help 'reset' maladaptive thought patterns in therapy (2).",
    "evidence_base": "A growing body of phase II and III clinical trials supports the efficacy of psychedelics for treatment-resistant depression, PTSD, and substance use disorders (3,4).",
    "effectiveness": "Studies report rapid and sustained reductions in depression and PTSD symptoms following psychedelic-assisted therapy (3). However, effects vary, and more research is needed to establish long-term safety and effectiveness.",
    "practical_applications": "- Currently limited to clinical trials or research settings in most countries.\n- Sessions are carefully guided by trained therapists.\n- Integration therapy after psychedelic sessions is essential.",
    "common_myths": "1. **Myth:** Psychedelics are always safe because they're natural.  \n**Fact:** They can cause intense and sometimes distressing experiences, so medical supervision is critical.\n\n2. **Myth:** Psychedelics 'cure' mental illness in one session.  \n**Fact:** While they can lead to profound insights, they're not a stand-alone cure and are most effective when combined with psychotherapy.",
    "risks_and_limitations": "Potential risks include 'bad trips' (challenging psychological experiences) and exacerbation of psychotic disorders in vulnerable individuals. Self-medication with psychedelics is not recommended outside of clinical settings.",

    "category": "interventions",
    "overview": "Neurofeedback, also known as EEG biofeedback, is a non-invasive technique that provides real-time information about brainwave activity. By reinforcing specific brain patterns, it aims to improve self-regulation and mental health.",
    "how_it_works": "Electrodes placed on the scalp measure brain activity. Feedback (e.g., audio or visual cues) guides the individual to modify brainwave patterns associated with focus, relaxation, or emotional regulation (1).",
    "evidence_base": "Meta-analyses suggest neurofeedback may be effective for ADHD and anxiety, though research quality varies (2).",
    "effectiveness": "Results for ADHD are promising, with some studies finding comparable effectiveness to stimulant medications (3). Effects for anxiety and mood disorders are more mixed and require further validation.",
    "practical_applications": "- Sessions typically involve 30–40 minutes of training, repeated over several weeks.\n- Conducted by trained practitioners in clinical or home settings.\n- Often used alongside other therapies or lifestyle changes.",
    "common_myths": "1. **Myth:** Neurofeedback can 'rewire' the brain permanently.  \n**Fact:** While it can improve brain regulation, effects depend on continued practice and reinforcement.\n\n2. **Myth:** It's a quick fix.  \n**Fact:** Neurofeedback usually requires weeks or months of training for meaningful changes.",
    "risks_and_limitations": "Neurofeedback is generally safe, but can cause mild headaches or fatigue after sessions. Its benefits are not guaranteed for everyone and depend on the quality of equipment and practitioner expertise.",
