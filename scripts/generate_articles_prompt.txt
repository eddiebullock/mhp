### 🔎 **Additional refinements you might consider:**

✅ **Request specific citation styles**  
If you want them in APA, MLA, or just "(Author, Year)" style, clarify in the prompt.

✅ **Clarify publication dates**  
E.g., "Include at least one study published after 2020 if possible."

✅ **Ask for balanced conclusions**  
E.g., "Summarize conflicting evidence if relevant."
